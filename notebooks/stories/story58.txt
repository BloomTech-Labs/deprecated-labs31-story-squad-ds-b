This new mission was one of the dangerous ones any of them had gone on so far. The risks were so much higher this time, and that being said, Harry Potter decided that to be as safe as possible and to get through everything in one piece, there needed to be code names. "Okay guys. I'll be Eagle One." Harry looked at a tall young man with light brown hair and dimples. "Cedric: 'been there, done that'." Cedric blushed very lightly and looked down at his lap, but said nothing else. Then Harry looked at a young man with blonde hair. "Draco: 'currently doing that'.""Excuse you." Draco muttered, but other than that he didn't put up any other fight. To a gangly young man with bright red hair... "Ron: 'it happened once in a dream'." "...what." And then, to a girl who sort of looked like Ron with the same hair: "Ginny: 'if I had to pick a girl'.""Eh, that's fair." Ginny shrugged. She wasn't conceited or anything, but she knew she was good looking too."And lastly..." he looked at another girl, this one with frizzy brown hair. "Hermione... 'Eagle Two'.""Oh thank god." Hermione muttered. She didn't want to be involved in Harry's sex life like her friends.
