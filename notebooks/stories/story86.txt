“I'm a big boy now, I want a broom.” Harry said firmly.
 
“No,” Severus said simply. “You're too young for one.”
 
“Draco's got a broom!” Harry frowned and crossed his arms.
 
“And if Draco jumped off a cliff would you hurl yourself off one too?”
 
“If I had a broom I wouldn't need to, I could just fly down.” Harry snapped back cheekily.
