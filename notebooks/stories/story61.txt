Just, an entire fic where the students come up with even more outrageous ways to get around Umbridge's instructions for homework. There's no way some more spiteful students didn't take great pleasure out of doing this. 
 
“What is this chicken scratch?”
“Excuse me, professor, but it’s Chinese.”
“Why did you write your essay in Chinese?”
“You never said I couldn’t." 
-.-.-.-
"This is just a single sentence written in huge letters for 15 inches!”
“The only requirements you set was that the assignment had to be 15 inches long." 
-.-.-
*hands in a book* "What is this?”
“My homework assignment. I wrote a book on the topic last year. It is ministry approved and you didn’t state I couldn’t use previous work." 
-.-.-
“This is over 100 inches!” 
“All you said was 12″ minimum. I’m very passionate about this topic.”
