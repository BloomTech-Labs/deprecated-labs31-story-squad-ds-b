The first fall down the stairs had been painful.Exhausted from the stressful first day – and the terror at the thought of his parents finding out he wasn't in Slytherin – and sore from the beating his father had given him that morning, Sirius had been less than delighted when the stairs to his dormitory had suddenly turned into a slide, causing him to fall straight onto his arse and down onto the floor, a yelp escaping his mouth as he went.“Are you okay?”Lily Evans, who he had briefly become acquainted with on the Hogwarts Express, held a hand out with concern as he shifted himself to standing again, lugging his trunk up.“I'm fine.” Sirius replied, giving her a wink. Lily rolled her eyes and stormed up the reformulated stairs: it seemed she'd been logical enough to take her trunk up as soon as she reached the Gryffindor tower. With a sigh, Sirius tried again, and this time grabbed hold of the rail as the stairs turned into a slide once again, sending him back down to the bottom.It took Sirius a second to comprehend what had happened.Grinning, he turned towards the boy's dormitory.His gender was male.
