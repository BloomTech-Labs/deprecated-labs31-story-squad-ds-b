Dear Professor McGonagall,
While your letter concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was appreciated, I am afraid that I am going to have to reject your offer due to other arrangements concerning my sons education, both magical and non-magical. 
My son had been given the best tutors this planet and many others can provide, in both magical and non-magical, or as you refer to it 'muggle', subjects. 
Thank you for your offer, please do not contact us again.
Sincerely, 
Alexander Joseph Luthor
