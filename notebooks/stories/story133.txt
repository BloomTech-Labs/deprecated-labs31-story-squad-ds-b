“Draco has fencing lessons.” Harry said, peering up over the counter to see what Severus was cooking.
 
“I know.” He answered, chopping skillfully, trying not to elbow Harry who was getting in his way.
 
“I have to play in his nursery when he has them.” He mumbled, resting his head on the side and taking a piece of bell pepper. “Why don't I do fencing?” He asked, placing the vegetable in his mouth and staring up at Severus curiously.
 
“Because you're dangerous enough without a sword.” The man laughed, swatting away Harry's sneaky hands as he went to steal another piece.
 
“He said it's boring, but I think it looks like fun.” Harry said, jumping into a fencing pose and cutting his arm through the air as though wielding a sword, smacking Severus' leg in the process.
 
“Remember what I said about you being dangerous enough?” Severus asked, rubbing his thigh.
 
“Sorry.” Harry said apologetically, Severus handed him another slice of pepper.
 
“Now, go on,” He said ushering Harry to the door. “I'll call you when dinner's ready.”
