Draco Malfoy had the weirdest soulmate tattoo out of all his friends. Of course, it was always covered with glamor, but he was still quite certain of its oddity. He looked down at it for the fourth time that day. The scrawl was in between the borderlines on messy and neat. It was an unusual sight for a pureblood.
