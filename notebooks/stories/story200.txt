"I can't decide whether the author of these comics has never met a Muggle before in his life, and therefore has no clue what they are actually like," Hermione said to Ron after spending a blessedly-boring summer in his attic bedroom binge-reading Martin Miggs comics, "or that he is actually secretly a Muggle born just taking the whole wizarding world by the nose with this ridiculous portrayal of Muggles, because take Ebony, the girlfriend that Martin has in the My Immortal arc: does the author think that Muggle women actually dress and act and speak like that? But at the same time, there are obscure Muggle references , like Martin randomly just talking in Yoda-speak sometimes, and these are just strategically scattered about in a way that makes me wonder if the author is just having enormous fun leaning into wizard stereotypes of Muggles while raking in wizard gold. Either way, it's so fascinating!"
