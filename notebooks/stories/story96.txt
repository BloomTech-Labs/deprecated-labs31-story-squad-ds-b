---Dear Professor McGonagall,Unfortunately Harry has decided that he will not be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry because he has decided to pursue  a non-magical, or 'muggle' as I have been told you refer to anything non-magical, education.Harry's magic is powerful and I and my wife do recognise that he will need to control his power as to not hurt himself or anyone around him. So, because of this, we have found some reliable magical tutors to help him.Sincerely, Barry AllenGuardian of Harry James Potter-Allen---
