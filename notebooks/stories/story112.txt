When we lived together under the stairs all of those years, you could give me forever, and take my serpent tongue.  Still they cursed us and we crawled.When we lived alone with our familiesâ€™ graves all of those ages, you gave me eternity; you took my wrath and infamy.  Still, our fathers figures failed us, left us, lied to us.  I thought that we could rise above the steps; I thought that there was more that we could be.  Under the chair, I gave you strength and history; I gave you yourself.Remember when you died?That was me.
