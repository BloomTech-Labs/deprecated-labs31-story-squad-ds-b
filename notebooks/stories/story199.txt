Remus shouldn't miss him. He couldn't, he wouldn't miss him. He would avoid his name and pretend, like everyone else, that he had never existed. He would mourn Lily and James, hope for Harry and admire Peter's desperate bravery.But it found himself doing things—sweeping his hair off his forehead, combing his quills' feathers, and leaving doors open—things he had never done before. He was keeping all the habits that had annoyed him in Sirius.So he lived on in Remus, the way Harry's parents could be seen in him, and McGonagall always laid a place for Peter.
