 Azkaban was a fine structure. That was what Harry thought the first time he entered the building. It was huge and could keep perhaps a thousand of prisoners. The prison was dark, gloomy and cold but, as Harry learned fast enough, the prisoners were warm and friendly ( well... you could say that... ) and when Harry was cold, all he had to do was ask(?) and big arms would envelop him into a warm and tight embrace.Harry liked hugging people and being hugged in return. It was a fact that the prisoners learned almost immediately. Apparently it also was one of the reasons that sent Harry in prison: the small teen killed Snape in a fit of rage when the old bat refused to be hugged. Oh... well, too bad for him. They wouldn't complain, they never really liked him anyway.Harry always had a thing for dark things so it wasn't surprising to seet that he wasn't scared of Azkaban. It also shouldn't come as a surprise to see him hugging former Death Eaters or worse (really?): Dementors.Before that, Barty wasn't aware of the fact that, yes, Dementors could blush.So yeah, Harry liked Azkaban... and the guards... and the prisoners... and also - !So, no, he won't follow the headmaster nor the minister out of his new home. No way in Hell.See ? He even learned how to properly curse while being stuck here. [ And to be fair, he wasn't really stuck there, he just decided to humor the stupid Ministry peuple and senile old man. ]
