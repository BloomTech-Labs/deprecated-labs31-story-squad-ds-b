---Dear Deputy Headmistress Professor McGonagall,I am writing to inform you that I will not be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry due to the fact I have already accepted a place at Salem Witches' Institute.Because I now live in the USA with my mothers half brother and my cousins, we feel that it would be much more convenient to go to school here rather than another school in another country. Thank you for your letter and consideration,Harry Potter-Winchester---
