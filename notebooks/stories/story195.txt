The man in the painting seemed to slumber, but Minerva McGonagall was not fooled. She'd always been able to tell when Albus was faking. Another sharp pang of pain passed through her at that thought. She should look away. It was very difficult, even as her sight began to blur. She blinked a few times, ashamed of herself.It wasn't fair.
