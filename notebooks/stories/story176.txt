---Dear Professor McGonagall,I would love to accept a place at Hogwarts School but my sister, Susie, didn't come home the other day and everyone is really worried. I just really, really want to stay with my family until she gets back.Is it okay to accept a place for next year? Sincerely,Harry Salmonp.s. I think your records need updating because my name changed when I was adopted a long time ago.---
