I open the door, dismayed but not surprised to see Harry Potter and his friends on my doorstep. They said Potter would come here, though I don't know how they knew. They said that I would have to turn him and his friends over if I wanted to see my precious Luna again.I invite them in. I can't look them in the eye-- I'm terrified that my betrayal will show there, that they'll flee and I'll lose my dearest Luna forever. But they stay, and they listen as I talk.I wonder what they've done that Death Eaters want them. What did Luna do wrong, after all? She befriended this boy and his friends. His friends-- they did nothing wrong besides knowing Potter. And Potter-- all he had done was fail to die as a baby. None of them deserve this. The other two, they have parents, parents who love them and will miss them just as I miss Luna.But it doesn't matter. I'd trade a hundred innocent children for my darling Luna. A thousand. I close my eyes as the Death Eaters arrive.
