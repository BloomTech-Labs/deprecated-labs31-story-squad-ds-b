"I can't. If I ever hurt you-""You're not going to hurt me, Severus. Quit fretting over it.""You can't be too sure of that. I could easily hurt you. In fact, it's quite possible that I might be required to hurt you.""And if that's the case, I'll get revenge.""Revenge?""Revenge. It will be quite sweet too. I'll be sure to kill Voldemort before you're able to harm me.""You have big dreams, Potter.""I know. It wouldn't hurt for you to have them as well."
