You’re far worse than any that were in my own.” With a swish of his cloak he was gone, leaving me alone in the corridor of the rundown manor. The door behind me opened. Relieved, I entered and knelt on the ground before the Dark Lord. “Ah, Wormtail, you know where the Potter’s live?” Without looking up, I nodded. “Godric’s Hollow.”

She pulled away, wrapping her arms around herself as she stared up at me. I turned away in shame. I took three steps before I spoke. “I’m sorry.”
