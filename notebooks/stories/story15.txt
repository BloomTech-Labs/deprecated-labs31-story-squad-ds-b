Dear Deputy Headmistress McGonagall,
While you letter was appreciated, I am afraid to say that Harry has already made plans concerning his magical education.
Due to how powerful Harry's accidental magic was at a young age his relatives left him with doctors at Arkham Asylum claiming he was both unstable and dangerous.  
Because Harry was placed in an asylum the American Ministry of Magic decided that due to Britain's Ministry of Magic's incompetence and failure to protect not only a magical child, but a child that is heir to four Ancient and Noble houses, two of witch are founders of your school, then they shall be the ones that would be responsible for Harry's safety and finding him an appropriate guardian. 
I may be a 'muggle', as you refer to non-magical people, but I can and have provided Harry with a caring home and the wonderful childhood that he deserves. Harry is aware of his heritage and how the wizarding world know him as the-boy-who-lived, however he has no plans to go back to England at this point in time or any time in the future. This may change in the future, only so he can proform his duitys as the head of several Ancient and Noble houses aswell as owner of Hogwarts school.
Harry will not be attending Hogwarts, please do not attempt to contact us again.
Sinceraly, 
Bruce Wayne
Owner of Wayne Enterprises 
Legal magical guardian and non-magical guardian of Harrison James Potter-Wayne, Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Potter, Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Gryffindor, Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Slytherin
