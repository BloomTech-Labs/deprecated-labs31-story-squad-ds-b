Dear Professor McGonagall,
I am afraid your offer has come a bit late as I am already enrolled in a magical school, Durmstrang Institute and I have no intentions of transferring schools at this point in time.
I may be tempted to visit Hogwarts School in the future but I am quite content with my education at this time.
Sincerely,
Harry James Potter-Black
Heir to the Most Ancient and Nobel House of Potter, Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black
