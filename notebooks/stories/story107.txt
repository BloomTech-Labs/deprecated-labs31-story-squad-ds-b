Harry,
I hope that your holiday is going okay and I want to remind you that if you have any problems we’re all here Harry, the whole team. If you need anything just owl, even if it’s just to speak to someone.
I’ve been owling everyone to let them know that Quidditch practice will be happening twice a week after the holidays, if we really practice enough and work out all the weaknesses in our tactics then we will be winners of the Quidditch cup again this year, hopefully.
I haven’t decided which days of the week yet though, because I wanted the whole team to have their say so there will be a team meeting in the first week back, I’ll be putting a note on the notice board in the common room. So keep an eve out for it, we don’t want our Seeker to, miss out having his say now, do we?
Thanks harry, reply as soon as you can so I can start to plan a little before then,
Oliver
