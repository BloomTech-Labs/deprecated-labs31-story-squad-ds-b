They give him all the broken children, every year.
Severus hates the Sorting Hat, with its cheery songs about cunning and guile and means to an end, because everyone knows that what the songs are really saying is liars and evil and not to be trusted.
They give him all the broken children, the angry ones, the ones who arenâ€™t brave or kind or clever enough for anybody else.
They give him all the broken children, and Severus looks after them (he has to) and he loves them (someone has to).
They give him all the broken children.
Every year.
