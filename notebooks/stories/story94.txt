Madame McGonagall,
I am afraid that I am going to have to decline your invite to your school due to the fact that I have already made the decision to attend Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. 
I do not wish to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry nor do I ever wish to go back to England ever again.
My older sister Fleur already attends Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and our younger sister will be attending Beauxbatons Academy when she is of age.
Please do not try to contact me again.
Sincerely, 
Harry James Potter-Delacour
