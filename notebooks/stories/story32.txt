Chapter Text
---Dear Professor McGonagall,I appreciate the acceptance letter and everything but I'm quite happy with my current education and home at Camp Half Blood. Despite what you may think my mother is very much alive, when she was attending Hogwarts she was being punished by King Zeus, so she had no memories of who she was and was forced to live a mortal life. She is disappointed in Dumbledore and does not wish for me to attend Hogwarts School while the old bastard is still alive. Sincerely Harry Potter---
