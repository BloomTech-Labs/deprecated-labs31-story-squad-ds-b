Professor McGonagall,
Look, Harry said he didn't want to go back to England, okay. 
We can find he some tutors for magical and non-magical subjects here, he can lear whatever he needs to know or whatever he wants to know, alright? 
England isn't the only place in the world with a magical school, its not even the only planet that has a magical school. If push does come to shove then we are more than able to find Harry from a couple of different dimensions we go to quite often. 
Please stop sending more and more letters and owls, Harry has said no already and if you don't stop then we will just have to push back in the way we see fit to handle the situation. 
Leave my little brother alone.
One very pissed off older brother, 
Dick Grayson
