Dear Professor McGonagall,
The moment I accept a place at Hogwarts School is the day I decide that I no longer wish to be part of civilised society. Wizarding Britain is home to not only some of the most outdated and medieval laws to be seen in magical society, the British Ministry of Magic is one of the most incompetent and above all the most useless Ministry in the wizarding world. 
I shall seek a magical education in other more civilised countries.
Do not try to contact me again. 
Harry Potter
