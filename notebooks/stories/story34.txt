Severus had been expecting the question, but it came too soon nevertheless."Daddy, where did the zigzag on my head come from?"Asked with such sweet innocence.He fumbled.  "When you were very small, a bad wizard tried to hurt you. He made the mark.""Oh." So solemn, sometimes, his stolen son.  Clear green eyes gazed up at him with such perfect trust, such confidence."But you saved me, Daddy? From the bad wizard. So he can't hurt me again?"It took all he had to nod, but the blinding smile he received made it all worth it, over again.END
