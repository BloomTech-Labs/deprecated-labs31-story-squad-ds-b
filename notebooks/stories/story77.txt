"Pay attention; this is the most important thing I'll ever teach you.""You've said that about literally everything you have ever taught me," Harry pointed out.Shikako nodded sagely. "That just goes to show exactly how important my teachings are."Harry gave her Sasuke's best skeptical look. "Including 'escaping ropes while tied to a tombstone' training?""Especially graveyard-rope-escape training," Shikako insisted. "It could very well save your life one day."

Shikako wasn't actually sure Harry—currently a precocious 8 years old—would ever find himself back in England to potentially be tied to a gravestone, but he got here in the first place, so it wasn't outside the realm of the possible that the process might one day happen in reverse. And really, rope escape training was always useful.



Harry rolled his eyes (possibly also copied from Sasuke... but really, he could've gotten that from just about anyone on Team 7) and sarcastically enthused, "Yes, Sensei; of course, Sensei; your wisdom is boundless, Sensei."



Shikako paused for a moment to wonder if he was quoting something someone (definitely not Shikako) had once said to Kakashi, before dismissing it as irrelevant and returning to the matter at hand: "If you should happen to find yourself trapped in a house with failing blood wards and the only available escape route is by air..."
