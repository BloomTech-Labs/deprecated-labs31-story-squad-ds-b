time can be a circlebut there is no kindness there
Cocooned by scarlet fabric, magic unfoldsa tale of lives long past - and lostLetters spanning time, proof of a lossthat is not truly loss, but hurts as muchA friendship, severed by the impossibleand yet, maybe rebornits baptism are tears, because he who wasis beyond her reach, foreverBut he who is become may yetbecome as dear to her as he once wasA friend who sees, who understands.
Time is a circle, and not kindbut along the way, there is light.
