"Why does everything in here smell like Malfoy's hair gel?""You do realize we're bre--" Hermione tried. "Never mind that." Ron interrupted. "How do you know what Malfoy's hair gel smells like?" He wiggled his eyebrows. What a good friend. "Well when you've bullied a guy for as long as I have, you tend to realize what he smells like." Harry just shrugged. "But guys," Hermione tried again.

"Not soon enough, that's for sure."
