“Harry, that is disgusting, do you have to?”
 
“But it's wiggly... look!” Harry said opening his mouth widely, using his tongue to waggle his tooth.
 
“I can see.” Severus said, curling his lip at the gross display. “It's going to come out soon. Don't suck it like that.” He tutted.
 
“But it's annoying!” Harry groaned, unable to help the need to mess with it.
 
“So are you, but I don't wiggle you around, do I?”
 
“Do you think the tooth fairy will give me lots of money for it?” Harry asked, flopping down on the sofa next to Severus, curling up to him and staring up expectantly.
 
“I think the tooth fairy is on a budget.”
 
“I think the tooth fairy's cheap.”
 
“Even cheaper when it's a tooth from a rude mouth.” Severus smirked at him.
 
“How much are teeth worth?”
 
“Why? Do you want to know if you're getting a good deal? Trying to play the market?”
 
“Yep.” Harry nodded emphatically, making Severus chuckle as he thought.
 
“I'd say about 4 sickles.” He eventually decided on.
 
“That's nothing, my tooth's worth much more than that!”
 
“Perhaps 8. How should I know what the going rate of teeth are?” He would have to ask someone, probably Narcissa.
 
“You know how much giants toenails are.”
 
“Touché.”
 
“What does that mean?”
 
“It means go brush your teeth, it's time for bed.” Severus said, giving Harry's butt an encouraging pat as the child got up.
 
“No, it doesn't.” Harry said with a frown, disappearing through the door.
