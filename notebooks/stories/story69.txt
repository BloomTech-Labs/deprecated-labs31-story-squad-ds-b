"No!" Harry grabs wildly for the ink bottle as it falls from the tower of books Hermione had built between them, but it's too late. The bottle slams into his Potions essay, sending ink flying all over his hard work, the books Hermione'd gotten from the library just yesterday, and even his face."Oh, no!" Hermione gasps, pulling her wand from its pocket inside her school bag. "I'm so sorry, Harry! Tergeo!"He stares as the ink disappears as though sucked up into his sister's wand. "That is an extremely useful spell. Please tell me you're planning to teach me."
