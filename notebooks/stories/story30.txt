Dear Professor McGonagall,
I will not be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
I would rather run off in to the sunset with an angel while riding on the back of a unicorn, than attend Hogwarts. 
You can not offer me anything that I need, nor can you offer me anything I want. 
While attending Hogwarts School I would not be able to continue preform my duties or learn anything that would be of any value or need to me because oh Hogwart's bias towards 'light' based magic teachings. 
However I would be happy to consider your offer, for a price, of course. 
But unfortunately I have some pressing business to attend to and a few debts to collect. 
- Prince Harrington Crowley 
Son if Fergus Crowley, King of the Crossroads
Or as you know me, 'Harry Potter'
