Harry listened in silent fury to this discussion about him happening in front of him and took a deep breath to be sure he could speak without screaming."You know what I don't understand, Remus? I don't understand why you seem to think DumbledoreÂ is going to help you solve all the problems you helped create. I mean, he can't even solve any of his own problems, really."Remus looked very disappointed in him, but for the first time, Harry really and truly did not care. He was watching Dumbledore, who was frowning at him. He didn't look nearly worried enough for Harry's tastes."What? Did you think no one could find out?" Harry let his teeth show in a smile just for the headmaster that wasn't meant to be at all reassuring. For once, Dumbledore seemed concerned and Harry's smile widened."Nothing to say now, headmaster? But you've always had so many opinions about the Greater Good. Surely you haven't run out of things to say about my role in your plans?" Harry couldn't help it - he laughed. "Would you like to tell them, sir, or should I?"Dumbledore's grip on his chair arms was nearly white-knuckled but he had otherwise composed himself to respond, "Harry, I have no idea what you're talking about. I understand this experience has been traumatic for you. We were simply trying to avoid upsetting you with a discussion of details that you needn't concern yourself over, my boy."Harry laughed again."I guess I'll start then, since we're discussing details that aren't anyone else's concern. Why don't we talk about Gellert, Dumbledore?" The old man's eyes went slightly wide and Harry's smile wasn't even pretending to be more than a baring of teeth now."Or better yet, why don't we start with Ariana?"Dumbledore's cheeks bleached white and Harry felt the old man's magic rise in distress and fury."Don't worry, sir, I'm sure the details of your life aren't really your concern. I'm happy to do the talking, you can just listen."
