---Dear Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,I am writing to inform you that I will not be attending your school due to the fact that I am currently attending the Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork.Please do not try to contact me again as I, and several of my friends, are quite angered by your claim to be the finest magical education provider in the world, despite no evidence or other achievements to support such a claim.Sincerely,Harry PotterStudent at the the Unseen University, Ankh-Morpork.
