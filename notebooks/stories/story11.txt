Chapter Text
---
Professor McGonagall,
I for one refuse to let my child be treated like a pawn in your fool puppet masters doomed game plan in the name of the 'greater good', therefore it has been decided that Harry will not be attending Hogwarts School now or at any time in the future. 
Sincerely, 
Loki Odinson of Asgard, God of Mischief
