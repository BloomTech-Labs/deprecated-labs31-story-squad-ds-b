It is my duty to uphold the honor.It is my duty to continue the line.I have a status to maintainand an image to uphold.always pure is the wayour family must remainconstantly trimming the tree of thosenot worthy of being a part ofThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Charred circles on the family tapestryare what they have becomebut I am not one of them.I never will be.I refuse to become anything but whatIâ€™m supposed to be becauseI know nothing else andhave no place left to gobut where my parents lead me.No time to dwell on the pastand those who have left,because there is no one butmyself.
