The first day of spring was exactly as spring should be. It dawned bright and cold, with the faint promise of a warm afternoon. Remus wandered, enjoying the outdoors, the sun, the air.All proper spring days instil hope and optimism in everyone, and he felt it, however slightly: the feeling that things where were they had to be, that things would work out, in the end.Sirius had always hated the spring. As human he got hay-fever, and as a dog fleas. Remus had laughed at him, then. Now he patted every happy big black dog he could find.
