Dear Professor McGonagall,
Thank you for the letter concerning my acceptance to your school, but unfortunately I have already made plans for both my magical and muggle education which means the I will not be able to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
However I would like to, if at all possible, visit Hogwarts School at some point in the future. I would have to be accompanied by my dad, Tony Stark, and my tutor, Doctor Strange (you may know of him as he is ore often than not referred to as the Sorcerer Supreme). 
I would also like to inquire as to what subjects Hogwarts School provides it's students with, I thank you in advance for any information that you can provide me with. 
Sincerely, 
Harry James Potter-Stark
Sorcerer in training
