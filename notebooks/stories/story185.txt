remus lupin and the wolf inside




inspired by the song 'come alive' by beth crowley




.


you are staring at yourself in the mirror
at remus lupin
the boy turned werewolf
you will tell yourself you do not need anyone
what you have is already inside you
.
no one had really ever known the details of how it began
no one had ever asked
they had found you bleeding in the backyard and rushed you off to st. mungo's
and that was the end of it
[so they didn't know]
.
they didn't know how the wolf had truly shown itself to the young wizard
fascinated by the glinting intelligence in the wolf's eyes
it filled you with a kind of pounding fear that seemed to light every part of you aflame
.
everything after that was a blur
you didn't really know what had happened.
/\
those nights you came alive with a sense of fear and adventure and most strangely…
you felt love.
…
for the wolf inside of you
you should hate it for transforming you into this…

creature.

but you don't.
.
you never do.
.
why?
.
you push it away
you try to hate the monster inside of you
but all you end up doing is hating yourself
[well, maybe that is what you deserve

freak. monster. worthless. creature.]

.
the flame inside of you is growing
it wants to be seen by your ever-averted eyes
soon you will finally see it and it will blind you with its roaring light
/\
you are growing more attuned to the wolf's feelings with every day that passes by
it matters no more if it is full moon or not
you are hearing the wolf speak in your mind
its soothing voices awakes some primal rage inside of you
.
you roam free that night
you are letting go to the wolf on those moonlit days
you are coming alive
.

wakeupwakeupwakeup

a million billion trillion different voices
hissing snaking roaring mewing barking speaking
in your mind
the wolf is speaking to you
the wolves are howling at the moon
.
you fall in love with the wolf
and you fall in love with yourself
you cannot hate yourself anymore
it is not what you deserve
you can understand that it was never your fault now
.
you run free that night
you don't care anymore
you don't care about hating about thinking about staying
you are running and it feels so

free

you are free
and that is the best part of it all
.
for one night you leave behind your daily fears
you forget the past and throw away your future
you embrace the

right now

you are screaming and howling and you love the feeling
you are not holding back anymore
.
you embrace the inside of your heart
the snarling terror
the primal rage
but the unspoken love
the barking laughter of young pups
it overtakes the faults of the whole
.
embrace yourself
stop running in circles
chasing your own tail
you are yourself and no one will change that
you are your evils and your goods
you are the wolf
but you are also the human
each has its evils
and each has its beauties
.
embrace the wolf
embrace yourself
feel the fur upon you
and you fall apart inside as you accept who you are
but you crumble and then you rise inside
you are resurrecting into yourself again
.
the darkness of your so called disease runs in your very veins
it runs deeply in your soul
and it is not wrong that you would never change that
that will never be wrong
.
you are waking into a new you
you are waking into a future into which maybe you won't be so hated anymore
maybe you won't be so despised
.

if you want to change the world, you have to start by changing yourself.

.
you are changing but yet you are still the same
you are still

you

.

the moon is shining tonight.


you are waking up.
