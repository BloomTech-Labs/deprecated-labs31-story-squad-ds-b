Who ever you think you are,
I demand that you freaks leave my nice normal family alone.
The freak child isn't here anymore, I don't know where he is but his unnaturalness turned his teachers hair blue and I have found him talking to snakes in the garden a number of times, so we left him at an orphanage. 
I don't know what happened to him, nor do i care what happened him to him.
You freaks need to stop sending the filthy birds to our house.
Yours Sincerely,
Petunia Dursley
